#Overlook Hotel

## Abstract
 [//]: <>
 - This app is built as a hotel website. A user is able to log in to the site, look at their bookings with images, room details and date its booked for. They are able to use a booking dashborad in order to book new rooms filtering by both date and room type. If no rooms are available from a date then a message will be displayed that no rooms are availabel. From there they may return to their page to view the new added bookings.
